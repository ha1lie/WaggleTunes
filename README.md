# WAGGLETUNES
## By Hallie

WaggleTunes is a system-wide music controller for iOS, originally released on Packix for $1.25, which is now opensource and free. 

**DISCLAIMER**
This package is published as is, without warrantee. This is the latest code which was released on Packix as version 1.3.1. The code found here may or may not be comprehensible, however, *does* indeed function, as far as I am aware of. 

**PERMISSIONS**
This code is now part of the public domain, and I give any developer the right to use or change this code under their own name with these exceptions:
 - Any and all changes must be substainial if the code is to be repackaged,
 - Any published projects, packages or tweaks made with this, or with the assistance of this package must also be opensourced,
 - Any packages, products, projects, or tweaks which use a large portion of this must link back to the original repo ([here](https://github.com/ha1lie/waggletunes)), and make proper credits to the author (Hallie)
 - As otherwise stated by the MIT License

WaggleTunes was my journey in learning tweak development, and Objective C, and I hope that some other people may be able to learn from this as well
